# Graphics-Lab-4
Lab 4 for Computer Graphics course, working with specular, diffuse, and ambient lighting.
This program is designed to experiment with lighting and see how an object looks while
toggling on/off specular, diffuse, and ambient. In addition, the user can also move the light
in x, y, and z coordinates, increase/decrease the shininess of the object, and change the 6 
parameters of color of the object with a JavaScript extension, jscolor.
